# iTunes Hook

Run `~/.ituneshook` executable when a song starts. It passes the current artist name, album and track.

Just run the iTunesHook.app. This will start a background process that will be added to your login items.

Here's a sample script that displays the song info using `growlnotify`.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
artist=$1
album=$2
track=$3

/usr/local/bin/growlnotify -a /Applications/iTunes.app -t "${track}" -m "${artist} â€” ${album}"
```
